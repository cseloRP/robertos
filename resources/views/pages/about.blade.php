                <p class="text-column">
                    Ruthin is the county town of Denbighshire in north Wales. Located around a hill in the southern part of the Vale of Clwyd, the older part of the town, the castle and Saint Peter's Square lie on top of the hill, while many newer parts are in the flood plain of the River Clwyd. Ruthin also has villages on its outskirts, such as Pwllglas, Rhewl Llanrhaeadr

                    Cyffylliog and
                    Gellifor. The town's name comes from the Welsh words rhudd (red) and din (fort), referring to the colour of the red sandstone that forms the geologic basis of the area, and of which the castle was built in 1277–84. Ruthin's original name was Castell Coch yng Ngwern-fôr (red castle in the sea-swamps).*
